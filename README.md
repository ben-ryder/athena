# Athena
A local-first app for notes, tasks and reminders.  

- Core Features:
  - Create notes, tasks lists and reminders.
  - Create note templates to easily reuse common note structures.
  - Organise your content with folders and tags.
  - Markdown based notes.
  - Use vaults to organise your data where each vault is its own collection of notes, tasks, folders etc.
- Online Features:
  - **Cloud Storage** - Sync your data to the cloud so you have access from anywhere.
  - **Cross Device Sync** - Sync your data across unlimited devices. The app will automatically fix conflicts if multiple devices edit the same file simultaneously too!
  - **Offline Support** - Make changes offline and they will be synced when your back online.
  - **Client Side Encryption** - All your data is encrypted client side meaning only you will ever have access to your data.

## About
**This project is very early in development and is not complete, stable or in an MVP release state yet.**  
As I planned to open source this at MVP release anyway I thought I may as well just do it now.

More documentation including usage instructions, development setup etc will come closer to the `v1.0` release.

## Contributions
This project is open source, not open contribution.  
This is a personal project currently so while your more than welcome to try it out and even raise bug reports and similar
I'm not interested in external code contributions or feature requests right now.
