## About
**This project is very early in development and is not complete, stable or in an MVP release state yet.**  
As I planned to open source this at MVP release anyway I thought I may as well just do it now.

More documentation including usage instructions, development setup etc will come closer to the `v1.0` release.

## Project Structure
This is a monorepo containing all projects related to Athena:
- `web` - The web application for using Athena in a browser.
- `mobile` - The mobile application for using Athena on Android (POSSIBLY PLANNED FOR SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE).
- `design` - Contains designs, wireframes etc

## Contributions
This project is open source, not open contribution.  
This is a personal project currently so while your more than welcome to try it out and raise bug reports and similar
I'm not interested in external code contributions or feature requests right now.
